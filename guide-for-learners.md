# Utilising Sockets with React
## Motivation: Why learn it?
Sockets are incredible powerful; it enables multiple users to manipulate data at once, where each user see's live changes. Combining sockets with React provides an extremely powerful development environment where a web app can be split up into components while sockets provide an excellent user experience. Live correspondance with servers seem to be the future of web apps especially for apps that are used for teams which seems to be a rising trend in apps. There's apps like Asana, Notion, Monday and soo many others which all utilise sockets. Social media sites also utlise sockets - you wouldn't want to refresh the page just to see if you've received a message or if someone has just posted. Therefore, to be a web developer in this current paradigm its imperative that you become comfortable using sockets.

## Background: What do you need to know before starting? Include links to material to catch up. Make it clear who your target audience is
### Node JS / Express

### React

### Redux (Bonus)

Before you start to implement sockets with React, it is important to know that you need to understand confidently how the React environment works and have a good general understanding of Redux - although you could avoid the use of Redux all together

- React
- Redux (optional) 
- Express/Node JS

## Learning materials: Provide appropriate links to external resources with commentary
- Link to some youtube videos
- Socket io documentation
- Existing github repositories - include kanban board

## Evaluation: How useful is the skill, compared with the effort of learning it? What similar alternatives are there?
The main alternative to using sockets would be to use a REST api which would be way more formal

- research sockets vs REST
- (diagrams)
- WebSocket API vs Socket IO
- Found it quite easy to learn but hard to structure files avoid it
- Definetly worth learn - future of web development
