# How to Use Sockets with React
## Motivation: Why learn it?
- Incredibly powerful - enables multiple users to edit data at once
- Real time gives for a better experience
- Works great with react and redux, since components don't need functionality for the sockets, can just fetch and update data straight from the global state

## Background: What do you need to know before starting? Include links to material to catch up. Make it clear who your target audience is
Before you start to implement sockets with React, it is important to know that you need to understand confidently how the React environment works and have a good general understanding of Redux - although you could avoid the use of Redux all together

- React
- Redux (optional)
- Express/Node JS

## Learning materials: Provide appropriate links to external resources with commentary
- Link to some youtube videos
- Socket io documentation
- Existing github repositories - include kanban board

## Evaluation: How useful is the skill, compared with the effort of learning it? What similar alternatives are there?
The main alternative to using sockets would be to use a REST api which would be way more formal

- research sockets vs REST
- (diagrams)
- WebSocket API vs Socket IO
- Found it quite easy to learn but hard to structure files avoid it
- Definetly worth learn - future of web development
